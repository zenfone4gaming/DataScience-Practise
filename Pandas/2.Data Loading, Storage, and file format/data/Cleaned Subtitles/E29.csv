0:13,Sanyam Bhutani,"Hey, this is Sanyam Bhutani and you're listening to ""Chai Time Data Science"", a podcast for data science enthusiasts, where I interview practitioners, researchers, and Kagglers about their journey, experience, and talk all things about data science.

Sanyam Bhutani  0:46  
Hello, and welcome to another episode of the ""Chai Time Data Science"" show. In this episode, I interview Eugene Khvedchenya, a Kaggle competition master ranked in the top 150 on the platform, and a computer vision consultant, talk all about his journey into the field and Kaggle, and his recent team gold finish on the Severstal: Steel Defect Detection Kaggle competition, where his team finished fourth, bringing another gold medal to his profile. Eugene also says many great pieces of advice around writing code, good code, and specially good code for Kaggle competitions, along with our discussion on his open source efforts on Albumentations and another framework that he's currently working on, called Pytorch toolbelt. All of to which you can find a description in the links section of this podcast. Also, if you would like to know more about augmentations there's another interview with Dr. Vladimir Iglovikov on this podcast. So do check that out in case you're interested. For now, here's my interview with Eugene, all about Kaggle, his recent solution and best coding practices. Please enjoy the show. 

Sanyam Bhutani  2:00  
Along with a quick note and an apology to the listeners, as you might have noticed, I have not been releasing any interviews for the past two or three weeks. And that is because I decided to invest a lot of efforts into converting all of the previous 27 interviews on this series into blog posts, along with working on putting a proper 'data science term checked' subtitles for them. I'll also make an announcement: starting now- Slowly, the blog post of the previous 27 interviews will be rolling out in parallel, you can find the link to the website with these will be released. Along with all of the future video releases we'll have checked subtitles to help improve your experience. Instead of working towards the releases, I spend some time putting up support material for the previous ones and ensuring the future releases happened fluidly, both in terms of the video and audio stream along with blog posts. I hope that improves your experience a bit. I am of course very open to any suggestions. This is, this is a suggestion that I always wanted to work on. So in case you have any other ideas that you'd want me to incorporate, please do send them my way. And I hope this improves your experience of tuning into ""Chai Time Data Science"" a little bit. Without further ado, here's the conversation."
3:42,Sanyam Bhutani,"Hello, Eugene, thank you so much for joining me on the ""Chai Time Data Science"" podcast and especially agreeing for the AMA Section."
3:49,Eugene Khvedchenya,Thanks for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be here.
3:53,Sanyam Bhutani,"I'm honored to have you on the show. Talking about your background, you have a masters in software engineering and you have been working on computer vision for a decade now. Could you tell us how did you get started with data science or machine learning broadly speaking?"
4:08,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Sure. So my background comes from the classical computer vision. And this decade, I was doing computation on C++ or Python. And in the start of 2018, I started investing more into the deep learning and machine learning. Since I realized this is a really hot topic, and what convinced me to do this, which was understanding of the fact that the amount of efforts is needed to build some image classification or object detection system using deep learning techniques, is way smaller than it required to do the same for the classical handcrafted tradition."
5:09,Sanyam Bhutani,"Talking more about the classical area, so you actually have a Hall of Fame, as you mentioned it on your Kaggle profile. And you're currently a consultant in the computer vision area. Could you tell us more about your off Kaggle life and the problems that you're working on?"
5:25,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Sure. So yeah, as you've seen on my profile, I was into many topics. And currently, I'm working at a company for doing much identity verification as a service. And there we have plenty of tasks. But without going into the very deep details, which I think I won't be able to share, were using images to extract all the information from them isn't there, passport photos or driver license photos. So it's many topics, all related to computer vision or OCR face detection. "
6:13,Sanyam Bhutani,"Got it, and you're working on the deep learning stack or even the classical algorithm."
6:19,Eugene Khvedchenya,It's a combination of both. 
6:21,Sanyam Bhutani,Got it. Okay. 
6:23,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So there's still a lot of room for the classical computer vision, I think in many topics, in many areas, not only in our company, but overall. So it's good to have knowledge in, in both domains."
6:39,Sanyam Bhutani,"During my research, I also found three very interesting things on your Instagram profile. I'll have it linked for the listeners if they want to check it out, which is sports, travel and graphic cards, lots, lots and lots of them. Could you tell us more about your life outside of the technical world and what sports do you compete in and how do you balance this lifestyle?"
7:01,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Uh so and thanks for the question. For, to balance the work which is most of the time sitting in the chair you have to compensate, this was a decent amount of physical activity. "
7:19,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
7:20,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So, I enjoy cycling a lot. And recently I started doing open sea swimming, which I also enjoy and in winter, all kinds of the winter activities like snowboarding, that some fun off. So to to have this work life balance or work-sport balance. I try to do this through the year so that I keep myself in a good shape since sitting eight or so hours, it's not, it's not something that your body wouldn't take a say, thank you."
8:06,Sanyam Bhutani,"Yeah. For the audience. I'd also like to mention that Eugene doesn't only win medals on Kaggle he's also won a bunch of medals on cycling competitions, I think."
8:17,Sanyam Bhutani,"Yeah, there was some of them in my past and also in inline skating that, yeah."
8:25,Sanyam Bhutani,Got it. So you an active sports competitor as well outside of Kaggle.
8:31,Sanyam Bhutani,"Yeah, we can we can say that."
8:33,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. Okay. Coming to Kaggle. Could you tell us what made you sign up for your first competition and how did you end up getting started on Kaggle?
8:42,Eugene Khvedchenya,"It actually was the same time I decided to learn deep learning. And I'm kind of a practical kind of person who learns by solving some real challenges and not very good at just learning the theory. I need to get my, my hands dirty with some tasks. So that's why I went to Kaggle and at the time there was a, icebergs the light detection challenge. It was the start of 2018 I think. So that was my first Kaggle competition. I was totally newbie in the deep learning. And I tried to make my way to this by reading the learning materials available in a great amount on YouTube, some lectures, and basically building mindset of knowledge and my set of skills. And that competition I finished about on the 100 something place."
9:56,Sanyam Bhutani,Right.
9:58,Eugene Khvedchenya,"And it was the first time and the first lesson to me that I learned, is that on the Kaggle look for data leaks first. "
10:07,Sanyam Bhutani,Hahaha. Okay. 
10:10,Sanyam Bhutani,"So yeah, in that competition, there was a huge data leak that alone itself was able to get about, I mean, top 50 maybe."
10:22,Sanyam Bhutani,"Usually, ideally, that shouldn't be the case with most of the competition."
10:25,Eugene Khvedchenya,"It's true, it's true, but if you're coming, doing competitive machine learning, it's something they should always keep in mind. And that was the lesson I learned from there and, and then I continue to participate in all image related competitions. And the, and the first gold medal we won as a team was a data science bowl, 2018."
10:54,Sanyam Bhutani,"We just talk more about your recent gold finish, but could you give us another deeper idea of how do you approach learning materials? For example, online courses, any of your favorites? Or when you mentioned you're experimenting along with learning any tips or your part of how do you approach it?"
11:13,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So, usually I do the following. One there isn't, let's say new material or new video posted by, let's say, Jeremy. So I watch it either just fully, or by chance, and then try to immediately follow the idea and implemented if its implementation idea, right. So as I said, I'm a practical person and without implementing, it's, for me, it's useless. So I really like to implement implement stuff, right code and by doing this I learned better I would say, so not, not only learn as vanilla implementation, how it's written in some paper, but do your own small changes to see what's really the key of the article or implemented, so what's the crucial effect? That's I think, what works best for me"
12:27,Sanyam Bhutani,"Got it. For the audience. I'd like to mention that do check out the course by Jeremy Howard. It's called fast.ai if you're not familiar with it, it's, it's one of the best courses in my opinion as well."
12:38,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yeah, I thought I found this course super useful to know this. Know-hows, this really great, great source."
12:50,Sanyam Bhutani,"For sure. Coming back to your Kaggle and now professional life, how do you balance this Kaggle professional and sports lifestyle? How do you balance your day and night and kaggle and work?"
13:05,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So, the answer's simple, I usually have a couple of hours before I go to sleep. Now that I spent on writing some experiment codes and I just put it. Put my models, put my experiments to training trick so while I sleep or working at the daytime, the GPU funds are staying."
13:33,Sanyam Bhutani,"GPUs busy, hehe."
13:35,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yes, GPUs busy definitely. So this is something that allows me to do work and other activities while the models training so or I started training and then I go to the gym or cycling whatever. And it doesn't require you to be present."
13:55,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah.
13:56,Eugene Khvedchenya,"The model, the model can, can be trained without your attention. And that's, that's what's helped me."
14:03,Sanyam Bhutani,"Got it. And do you think after you started competing on Kaggle, and getting these amazing results that I'm sure many of the audience is familiar with, did it impact your professional life in any way? Did you have any takeaway learnings that you apply to the real world after that?"
14:19,Eugene Khvedchenya,"For me, it's hard to overestimate how helpful competing on Kaggle was for me. The amount of experience you get by going deep into particular problem is it just a tremendous. And you learn new architectures, you learn approach, you learn new ways to change your models, you learn new frameworks, and this gives all you, ground to perform better on your work or other pet projects. "
14:56,Sanyam Bhutani,Got it. 
14:57,Eugene Khvedchenya,"From, from this context, I would say it was really helpful to me to get into the deep learning. Since I was I was able to use the knowledge I got there in other places,"
15:14,Sanyam Bhutani,"Coming to frameworks. I've actually interviewed Dr. Vladimir Iglovikov, about Albumentations to with your, core contributor. So he's already talked about his side of the story for the audience, do check out that interview. But I'd also love to know more about your side of how did you get started with the framework and contributing to the idea."
15:34,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So just to give your audience a bit of context, there are Albumentations, is the image augmentation library that is massively used on cargo for the image augmentations and I got into the core team, by I adding a new functionality there, so, which I actually wrote for some past competitions. So the library itself was released, I think after Data Science Bowl, 2018. So, at that time, I had my own let's call it mini augmentation library. "
16:26,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
16:27,Eugene Khvedchenya,"That's, then I quickly throw to garbage and limitations. Since I found it, really alined with my line of thinking how the image augmentation could be done. And I started using it on a regular basis in our competitions and on demand added new features there and to allow others to use it so I made requests and at some point guys propose it that I became one of the maintainers and also help them on improving the library on some sort of the regular basis. "
17:16,Sanyam Bhutani,Got it. So;
17:17,Eugene Khvedchenya,"This is, this is how I got into the, yeah."
17:20,Sanyam Bhutani,Your Kaggle work also led you to becoming a better open source contributor in a way.
17:27,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Indeed it is. Before this, I haven't considered to do this sort of open source contribution about, I love it now. Yeah, it's, it's good to realize that library is used and appreciated by community. And it's, it's a great feeling."
17:55,Sanyam Bhutani,"For sure. Could you tell us more about another framework that I think you recently started, it's called Pytorch Toolbelts."
18:03,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yeah, it's currently just a product of mine. And at some point, I realized that the code I write for the Kaggle competitions, it doesn't change a lot. And there are typical building blocks that I tend to reuse over and over again, with a small modifications, maybe, but the idea remains the same. And so it took me maybe three or four challenges to realize I'm just with, with my time on copy, pasting and recording, where I change something called, where I introduced that feature, or fix that bug. So essentially, I filtered all this blocks and built library for just keeping them in one place, and so that I can reuse them easily."
19:09,Sanyam Bhutani,Got it. 
19:09,Eugene Khvedchenya,"And also, so this is what's, that was the initial idea and it was tailored for the Pytorch Library, which is my library of choice. And then it became more and more mature and had a new features like the stem augmentation that can be done on the GPU or a flexible way of building models and switching the encoder without having to rewrite your whole model. So all this building books helps me to quickly iterate over ideas, that I have in chat in competitions, and that was the purpose of this library to be a toolbelt. So it gives you a tools so for;"
20:02,Sanyam Bhutani,"I think this is again, a quote from a previous interview that I've done, a smart person back in the day used to have a large library of books now smart people, like you just have open source libraries that they keep contributing to."
20:16,Eugene Khvedchenya,"I think it's, it's really effective way to first of all, become visible to the community and also to offer what you have. And instead you give some feedback or community needs. And this also helps you to understand what actually is required. Or maybe you're missing some part of the puzzle. "
20:47,Sanyam Bhutani,Got it. 
20:48,Eugene Khvedchenya,"From this perspective, I think it's a win win to everyone. And as I said, it's also good to understand that this small piece of the open source code that he wrote is actually used by others."
21:05,Sanyam Bhutani,Yep. Do you have any best advice for some newbie who's looking to get started open source contributions?
21:11,Eugene Khvedchenya,"I think it's actually really good to try to get into the Google Summer of Code or similar events by other companies. And even for the Albumentations, we have plenty of issues for the newcomers. One can start with something, something really relatively simple, yet with its value. So looking for the project that has this filler issues. I think it's easiest way to get into the open source."
21:19,Sanyam Bhutani,"Got it, we will have Albumentations linked in the description of this podcast. Do check that out in case you're interested. Now before we talk all about your gold position, and the fourth position finish, first of all, congratulations to you on the amazing finish. And also, you just broke into the top 150 rankings of Kaggle competitions."
21:57,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yes, that's a good achievement, I think. And I'm not going to stop here."
22:29,Sanyam Bhutani,"So maybe by the time the audience gets to hear this, you might have a better rank than this."
22:35,Eugene Khvedchenya,Yeah.
22:37,Sanyam Bhutani,"Coming to the competition, it's, it's a tongue twister, but it's called Severstal steel defect detection Kaggle competition, could it help me set the stage by telling us what the challenge was in this competition?"
22:51,Eugene Khvedchenya,"The challenge was in the detection. The steel defects that appear when the steel, it gets forged and the problem statement was that when I was asked to build a system that would do a semantic segmentation of Steel sheets, I think made by special kind of the camera that produced grayscale images of 1600 pixels with 256 pixels height. And on this image, we had to detect for classes of the still defects and produce a mask indicating where each particular defect class is. The main challenge I think, for this competition was the extreme class imbalance and in the training data, look, it has maybe one just percent of one prior class, and another class dominated heavily into training samples. And there was roughly half of the train data was out defects the top quarter. "
24:14,Sanyam Bhutani,Got it.
24:14,Eugene Khvedchenya,"And the second, the second challenge in for this competition was it was a synchronous kernel on the competition, meaning that you have a limited amount of time limit to do the inference on the train set that is unseen, you cannot see the real test. They don't. And it's actually great, I think, and this puts all the team in the same conditions. So you cannot build the craziest ensemble of the 50 models have just unreasonable inference that I think it's really good to have more and more of such challenges on the Kaggle. So, these these are two main challenges on, I think that, that the participants was, so."
25:09,Sanyam Bhutani,"Could you tell us once you got interested in the competition and discovered the challenges of it, what were your first go to steps and how did you approach this problem?"
25:19,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Mostly most of the time, my approach is similar and I write, some, I call it fit predict script that establish my baseline, for any any kind of problem that it is. And the idea here is to ensure that the training loop itself the data preparation, is back free. So I can provide a reasonable model and I can do submission in the format that is required. So kind of make the baseline this is, the perspective."
26:02,Sanyam Bhutani,"Mhm, okay."
26:03,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Don't, don't try to get silver bronze gold from the first submission. Goal is to ensure you have a solid baseline ,that you have, the court itself is clean. So that even if you let's say put it for one month on ice, do something else and then go back you still can understand what's going on. So, I often hear from others like it's a, it's a competition, we have no time to make our court claim. "
26:40,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
26:41,Eugene Khvedchenya,"I respectfully disagree with the statement. The quality of the code that you write is really important for the Kaggle as well. It's maybe, even more important than the quality of what you're doing for your just everyday job. Because on Kaggle you have a very limited amount of time."
27:04,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
27:04,Eugene Khvedchenya,"And the cost of the mistake, if they happen to have your code, is multiplied since it's the most, it's usually the difference between winning and losing."
27:18,Sanyam Bhutani,"Mhm, that's a great point."
27:20,Eugene Khvedchenya,"And if you can avoid doing mistakes by using well structured code, static code checking out of formatting or ID features to help you spot and fix the issues, why, why not use it? "
27:42,Sanyam Bhutani,For sure.
27:44,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yeah, so that that's why my, my suggestion is to have a strong baseline. Have a clean baseline, discipline code that you are 100% Sure. It's it, don't have issues and build your way from there."
28:01,Sanyam Bhutani,"I think it also leads to amazing libraries eventually, maybe if you keep doing it consistently for a while, you might end up with something similar to augmentation or the toolkit."
28:14,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Sure, sure. So I'm competing on the Kaggle, almost two years from now, and I have some sort of templates for any kind of problems, could be either image segmentation or object detection or classification. And I think pretty much, pretty much everyone already have something similar to it. And to me, the key idea I try to follow is write as less code as possible. So if you, if you can use existing deep learning framework, there is no reason to use, use in which albumentations library without re-inventing the field, or reuse, whatever source you find confident and well maintained, it is worth using this despite write less code by yourself or in there, you reduce the chance of making a mistake."
29:16,Sanyam Bhutani,Again because you're under the time constraint as well. So you can invest your time better if you're using pre written code.
29:23,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Definitely, definitely, even if it's, if this code written by is yours and, for some past competition, it's good idea just to keep, to copy paste it and just result, from writing from scratch. Again, again put us into requirement to have gold."
29:42,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. Did you find any of your previous code being useful in this steel detection competition?
29:50,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yes, true. And actually, I, I refer to it and to make recent PyTorch toolbelt released exactly for this competition. "
30:00,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay.
30:00,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So that last function and metrics are supported, supporting the steel challenge. "
30:06,Sanyam Bhutani,Interesting.
30:08,Eugene Khvedchenya,"I constantly reuse the pieces of the code from my past competitions, in the ongoing. I think it's, this is how it should be. Most of the time, the problem can be narrowed to three big classes, is a classification problem, or it is a segmentation or the object detection. "
30:32,Sanyam Bhutani,Yep. 
30:32,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So essentially, you just need three solid pipelines that you then can extend to that particular problem. "
30:41,Sanyam Bhutani,For sure.
30:41,Eugene Khvedchenya,"It's, it sounds quite easy, right? But without going into very deep details, it's, difficult."
30:53,Sanyam Bhutani,"So definitely, as a takeaway for me and the audience. Please do spend some time writing clean code Can you tell us more about your team for this particular competition? And how do you in general, maybe pick your teammates and distribute the workflow? How do you track your experiments or come up with ideas when working? "
31:14,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Sure. So in this competition, we have a team of three of us. But distinction code Demtris, __ and I were from the same city. And guys has been working on this steel competition at the beginning, and I joined it not maybe, before months before the end, since I was busy in aptos blidness detection comp"
31:49,Sanyam Bhutani,Wait I think you're gold medal in that competition. 
31:52,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yeah, and uh. "
31:54,Sanyam Bhutani,Solo gold medal.
31:56,Eugene Khvedchenya,So that we can speak about it later. 
31:59,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
31:59,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So in Steel, our guys had plenty of resources in the cloud, and they offer it to join and join our forces on. So initially, when I jumped I didn't have much enthusiasm or kind of any goal, that's has been said beforehand. So I was thinking that it would be good if we secure silver. So there is an agenda, the competition was that I like the image segmentation. It's probably one of my best topics. And I wanted to be able to see what, what's in the steel what's data into how would it work. So that's why I join it and I really quickly make the baseline and when does baselines scroed really, really down  on the leaderboard may be something like 1000 place. "
33:06,Sanyam Bhutani,I see. 
33:07,Eugene Khvedchenya,"I get interested, like, what's happening why I'm not able to get the bronze. "
33:15,Sanyam Bhutani,You took up the challenge. 
33:17,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yes, the challenge has been accepted."
33:20,Sanyam Bhutani,Hahaha.
33:21,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So I started training more and more models there. And at some point I get closer to the bronze and at this time I was already interested. So how, how it could be and then we try, we merged with Debris and Dimitri and shared our ideas and the code. And regarding your question on how we check experiments, for me what works quite well is the document on Google or into ReadMe, some sort of table where I write, I write in the historical order, like experiment name, what the score wasn't the validation, what the score wasn't the leaderboard, some additional comments of what experiment is about. So this kind of, some sort of notebook helps me to keep in mind what I'm, actually already tried and what I have not tried yet. "
34:32,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
34:33,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So usually at the beginning of the competition, when I look at the data, I make a set list of ideas I would like to try over after have a baseline. Let's say I can write something like okay, I want to try so the labeling or I want to try some interesting clothes functions, or there's a new paper. I want to try. For me, each new each new competition is an opportunity to try something new. That's, that's my, the reason why I participating in every competition, I want to learn. I want to try new things. And it's an opportunity to me."
35:17,Sanyam Bhutani,"There's a prevailing sentiment as well, that you need quite a bit of compute power for gold winning solutions. Could you talk to that a bit, and maybe also share your setup for this competition."
35:30,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So in this competition, also, I personally all four GPUs, 1080Ti, which, for someone, it's maybe a lot done right. But if you took a, let's say a winning solution of the open images of the detection already supports a second place, but they used 120 GPU"
36:02,Sanyam Bhutani,"Completely unimaginable, at least for a person like me."
36:06,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Right? For me as well, and a lot is not very clear thing, right? So I would say, for the deep learning the minimum amount of GPUs to have is one."
36:24,Sanyam Bhutani,For computer vision at least.
36:25,Eugene Khvedchenya,"It's sufficient to start and I started with one GPU, and it's perfectly fine to, to learn and to compete with others, especially since you can use Google Cloud Credits or the Collaboratory notebook which gives you a decent GPU or even Kaggle. "
36:53,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah.
36:53,Eugene Khvedchenya,"There are time limits on Kagggle kernels, but it's still better than zero. "
37:00,Sanyam Bhutani,For sure.
37:00,Eugene Khvedchenya,So I can agree that having more GPUs is definitely helpful then having none or one and for me the reason of getting four GPUs is that so there are two reasons actually.
37:19,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay.
37:19,Eugene Khvedchenya,"The first one, it allows me to iterate faster on my ideas or my learning. I'm not speaking right now on Kaggle only I'm, I'm working remotely and I can build my own PC, which is working too. "
37:38,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
37:39,Eugene Khvedchenya,And I want my working tool to be as fast as possible and as efficient as possible. 
37:44,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
37:45,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So if we put this in this context, it's totally makes sense to;"
37:51,Sanyam Bhutani,Definitely.
37:52,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Invest, invest in your hardware."
37:55,Sanyam Bhutani,"Got it. Now coming to experimentation, as you Machine Learning specially 20 to 30 experiments usually don't work maybe more for Kaggle competitions. Can you speak to that a bit? How do you track your failed experiments and note the takeaways from them?"
38:15,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yeah. So, even 20 or 30 experiments is I would say to resemble in some past competitions article for me, I ran more than hundred experiments."
38:29,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
38:30,Eugene Khvedchenya,"And tracking then becomes really cumbersome. Tons of work, too. So, and also making notes on the experiments that went well and which went didn't good, is a crucial and also what I'm trying to do is use a get a history and the branch. Just to actually keep each experiment more or less isolated. "
39:08,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
39:08,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So let's say I have my main development branch, and if some experiments lead to success, it gets merged to the main branch so that I can keep the structure of the repository clean, yeah."
39:26,Sanyam Bhutani,"So when an experiment fails in Machine Learning, for example, you're modeling, how do you decide to continue giving it another try or putting an end to it? Because in machine learning the experiment doesn't work until it does."
39:39,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yeah. So I can you, give me, I can give you some examples in the steel challenge that I tried. So I had an idea that if I do, very interesting trick on a mature mutation, that it may help my model to generalize better, the trick was to use well known mixed up augmentation, but do it slightly differently. There is a technique on seamless image blending that allows to integrate one portion of an image into another one without any noticeable to Nick a boundary. "
40:30,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay.
40:31,Eugene Khvedchenya,"And my idea was okay, we have masks. So for the ground consolidation, so what why not we take the random defect from one image and put it into a second image, so that it would look natural. And I rolled this implementation, and it provided quite good results. I mean, visually, it was really not easy to say that it's artificially added the fact that and then they put the training of the model using this augmentation. So and I was hoping it will show rocket high score on the validation and the readable. And, it did not."
41:20,Sanyam Bhutani,"Hehe, okay."
41:21,Eugene Khvedchenya,"It did not at all. So at this point, I could either continue debugging this technique or try something else. And it's always a decision you have to make. So, what I usually do is I write unit tests for my augmentations or for other things that I potentially can fail and do unit tests will show you that I did okay with documentation itself. And the visual inspection also didn't reveal any issues. So I ditch that idea that because we had really a limited amount of time, so you have to be, you have to carefully choose where you spend your time."
42:15,Sanyam Bhutani,"My takeaway is also that since you've written some unit test, again, from your strong software experience so after testing, if the idea doesn't work, maybe it's some time to put an end into it."
42:27,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yeah. And this is, this is how you perform in Kaggle you have to try as many ideas as possible and some one may work, some ones will not work and it's okay. Yet some how you will have a box and this, it's also okay. But you have to keep going and keep trying as many ideas as you can, within a limited amount of time."
42:57,Sanyam Bhutani,"Coming to the final solution of your competition could you please maybe give us a high level overview of the gold winning solution. And I'd also really love to know what led you to the 86 position jump on the private leaderboard, that's also question by Thio Viel from the AMA Section."
43:13,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Yeah, so our final solution was an ensemble of five models, which was using stem augmentation of vertical and horizontal flips. And older prediction has been leveraged by a simple mean average and was a threshold of zero 55 we end up with a binary masks. So it sounds quite a simple solution and model architectures we have used it at work, Dense net 201 resnet 34, SEResNet 50 and a plain ResNet 50. So the final insurance plan was about 15 minutes. So, so we;"
44:11,Sanyam Bhutani,"Sorry, 15 minutes on kernels?"
44:15,Eugene Khvedchenya,Yes. 
44:15,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
44:16,Eugene Khvedchenya,Yeah. So the total influence then I was a 15 minutes. So we are way below the one hour req. 
44:24,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
44:25,Eugene Khvedchenya,"And actually we change three more models. But combination of these five had the higher accuracy, a higher score on validation on the leaderboard, so we end up with it. Apart from this, we turn it into much heavier models like high-high resolution net, or ResNet 152 and was a different kind of the decoders still produce more. But unfortunately, they didn't work quite well in this competition. And mine, I can only speculate why we jumped so high. But my understanding is that first of all, we didn't really rely on things like simple blending, and just showed adjustment. "
45:29,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay.
45:30,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So I think combinations of two facts is what helped us, since the dice metric itself, if you look at the leaderboard, it's, it was really close. So, and the naked eye, the difference between dice, zero point 91 and zero point 92 is, it's nothing."
45:56,Sanyam Bhutani,Hehehe.
45:57,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So it's essentially counting number of pixels between the different predictions what's put your higher. So I think, I think the fact that we didn't use to the leveling worked for, for us and many of the teams was really adjusting to short to get high on data port. In fact we did we did not end, we try to adjust our cross validation."
46:31,Sanyam Bhutani,Could you maybe speak a bit about cross validation skills that you picked up over time and any tips for that?
46:39,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Uhm, sure. So, for this competition, the validation scheme that I personally used was a stratified multi label cross validation. And this means that I tried to balance folds. So that the ratio of the combination of each defects is saying between the chain and validation. So in total I had a four folds for this and Dimitri and Maurice had different validation scheme but similar, so when we average our models it's also was working well because they we have some that divulge a model predictions here. What is what is, what is funny when we train it higher resolution at work which is was really heavy and it took maybe almost two days; "
47:46,Sanyam Bhutani,On your setup?
47:48,Eugene Khvedchenya,No on eight v100
47:51,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
47:53,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So it was like burning a lot of money but we, I had really high hopes for this network since It claims to have state of doubt performance on the Segmentation. And it didn't work anywhere close to look what we have was the resnet 34."
48:14,Sanyam Bhutani,Got it!
48:16,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So, this is Kaggle and;"
48:21,Sanyam Bhutani,"Yep, its Kaggle."
48:24,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So it's, it still can be the case that I have implementation problem in the, in the code, but this is how it can be, so."
48:38,Sanyam Bhutani,"Yeah. So this has been a great interview. My final question to you would be, what best advice is, maybe a single or multiple would you have for someone just started or just getting started on Kaggle or machine learning broadly speaking?"
48:56,Eugene Khvedchenya,"For me, using Kaggle for learning is great, great idea. And I see no reason why you shouldn't do Kaggling to practice your skills. It allows you to get into community, speak to others share ideas, get some tips or mentoring and learn from the public kernels. It's a great way to go in to get into the machine learning. So, keep going to competing, through Kaggling or there plenty other sources on the competitive machine non competitive platforms, not only Kaggle. So I think it's the right place if you have this; "
49:56,Sanyam Bhutani,Graphic Cards
49:58,Eugene Khvedchenya,"No, no graphic Cards. And to helpful know, but I mean, if you are competitive, "
50:03,Sanyam Bhutani,"Okay, got it. "
50:05,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So I can imagine that it's not in everyone's nature to try to push it's limits, right? "
50:14,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
50:14,Eugene Khvedchenya,"So if that's something that's resonate with your nature, then yeah, go for it. If If not, if you don't like it, or if you don't like to work in the time constraint conditions, it's probably not the best way for you to learn. And you have to find your way what's, what about, what was, what was best for you, but for me, it's definitely the way how I like."
50:41,Sanyam Bhutani,"Awesome, what would be the best best platforms to follow you and follow your work before we end the interview."
50:49,Eugene Khvedchenya,"Okay, so I think you're, can reach me on Kaggle forums and also on the Open Data Science slack. And feel free to reach me on my email, you can share it afterwards. So I'm open to any questions and you can ask me whatever question you have regarding computer vision or machine learning. Happy to answer."
51:21,Sanyam Bhutani,"That's really kind of you. Thank you so much, Eugene, for joining me on the podcast and thank you so much for all of your open source and Kaggle contributions."
51:30,Eugene Khvedchenya,Thank you very much for the invitation and see you on Kaggle.
