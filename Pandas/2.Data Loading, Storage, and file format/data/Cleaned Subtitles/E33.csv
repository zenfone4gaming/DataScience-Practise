0:13,Sanyam Bhutani,"Hey, this is Sanyam Bhutani and you're listening to ""Chai Time Data Science"", a podcast for data science enthusiasts, where I interview practitioners, researchers, and Kagglers about their journey, experience, and talk all things about data science.

Sanyam Bhutani  0:45  
Hello, and welcome to another episode of the ""Chai Time Data Science"" show. In this episode, I'm honored to be interviewing Kaggle legend, double Kaggle Grand Master and former number one on the competition still, Gilberto Titericz, also known as his username Giba on Kaggle. We talk all about Giba's journey into the field of data science broadly speaking, and also on Kaggle. Giba shares many amazing advises about Kaggle and also connect the dots for us of how those connect to the real world of data science. There are many advices about Kaggle, about data science and how to get your first break into data science. Giba has a background of electrical engineering when he got started on Kaggle and he says a very honest and transparent view of his journey into data science as well as Kaggle, so I'm really excited to be sharing this. A quick note to the listeners. This interview will have manually checked and uploaded subtitles to YouTube. So if you're a non-native English speaker, please remember to enable those for a better experience, along with the blog post release, that will happen later. And if you're interested in that, you can find the links to the website again in the description of this podcast. For now, here's my interview with Kaggle legend and former number one, Giba. All about data science and Kaggle. Please enjoy the show.

Sanyam Bhutani  2:29  
Hi, everyone, I'm on the call with the Kaggle legend, Grand Master, Giba. Grand Master Giba, thank you so much for taking the time and joining me on the team data science podcast."
2:41,Gilberto Titericz,"Thank you. Thank you Sanyam. It's a, an honor to be here today and talk with you and everybody watching and listening this video. Thank you really appreciate it."
2:52,Sanyam Bhutani,"It's really an honor to have you on the show. You're currently in the top four rankings of the competition's leaderboard. Could you tell us about your Kaggle journey, what got you interested on competing in Kaggle? And your path to becoming the number one eventually on the leaderboard?"
3:09,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, it's a long story. But sure. Actually, I was always in my life involved with, with algorithms and coding, but my graduation is in electronics engineering. Right. And I work for around 10 years, no more than that. Look, I work, I worked for 15 years as an engineer, well before that transition to the data science. Right. And but during that time, as an engineer, I was involved with coding and our teams, even my, my master was in the field related to optimization algorithms. I studied wireless communication and turbo coding, actually, this is the name, the correct name is kind of averaging two correct beats transmitted via wireless communication. Right. So I was always involved with, with some kind of algorithms during my entire life."
4:26,Sanyam Bhutani,"I was reading online, you were electrical circuit noob, you had created your first circuit board at the age of 10. I also saw a video of your segway boot testing that you made yourself."
4:38,Gilberto Titericz,"Uh huh. Yeah, that's true. I used to build my circuit boards by myself when I was a kid. "
4:46,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
4:47,Gilberto Titericz,"And then yeah, I do that, a Segway, also around six or eight years ago, while using microcontrollers. Yeah, it was very cool."
5:00,Sanyam Bhutani,And the coding and even the like circuitry portion of the project. Everything was done by you.
5:07,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, yeah, actually I do the circuit board using soldering iron. Iron you know, about melting iron, right. Or transistors. I use XML, microcontroller. I coded the streamer of the microcontroller also. It was pretty cool. I like that. But actually the most experiments in electronics in my life I made airplanes, electric power planes. "
5:39,Sanyam Bhutani,"I have seen videos of that also on you channel, I think the POV cameras from the drones."
5:45,Gilberto Titericz,"Exactly. I have some videos in YouTube. It's, I called it some, some onboarding circuitry and coding for a, let's go airplanes. It was my hobby for, for a long time, long time. Since they, they let Ricky motors appears in the markets for electrical airplanes I, I used to, to compute it. Aerial models, but i like, i like it, it's running stellar."
6:14,Sanyam Bhutani,So how did you Data Science-Sorry.
6:19,Gilberto Titericz,"I still loving the electronics and it's a hobby. But since 2016 I moved to data science, and I stopped doing any electronics as a hob, but I still want to do some some electronics hob in the future. "
6:41,Sanyam Bhutani,"Hehe. Okay, maybe, maybe we'll build a robot in the future. "
6:45,Gilberto Titericz,Yeah. 
6:46,Sanyam Bhutani,How did data science start to come into the picture for you? All of these years after working in the electronics domain?
6:55,Gilberto Titericz,"Yes, sure. Doing electronics, it's a matter of coding nowadays, right."
7:04,Sanyam Bhutani,Yep.
7:05,Gilberto Titericz,"So when I, when I figured out that doing machine learning is something related to that field, or at least in the internet of things, there is a way to mix everything, right. Electronics, hardware, software. I started to get interested for different kinds of algorithms. And I found Kaggle in 2012 or 2011. Don't remember exactly. But it, I loved it, since the first time. "
7:43,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay.
7:44,Gilberto Titericz,"Right. And when I joined Kaggle in 2012, I started two, two competitions in Kaggle at a time. There's two competitions running and I joined the two competitions, and it was about time series, a challenge, and there's a wind forecast. And I realize that I had to learn a lot to compete on that kind of competitions. My previous knowledge about software had nothing to do with these kind of competitions, right. This was data science in time series competition. So at that time, my, I, my knowledge about data science was based on my knowledge on MATLAB. MATLAB is I believe, you know that, but it's a page tool, for to, mostly use it for universities and students, but also, I started to use MATLAB and Kaggle, especially the MATLAB neural networks toolbox. I use it, as two, first competitions to, and I was bit lucky I got a top three  and atop 11 on my first two competitions in Kaggle. "
9:07,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
9:09,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah. And in that time, it motivated me a lot more to continually learning that different youth on the time. Right. So, it was a bit of lucky. But also, I spent a lot of time on those two competitions and Kaggle also, because I found it very interesting. And, and yeah, I got to stop 311 and at that time, it was enough to become Masters in Kaggle."
9:40,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
9:41,Gilberto Titericz,"And at that time Master was the top ranking in Kaggle, right. So;"
9:47,Sanyam Bhutani,"For the audience, the title was introduced much later after Giba had started, that's a recent addition to Kaggle."
9:56,Gilberto Titericz,"Exactly. So I got the title, Master title in Kaggle really soon, and it motivates me to continue a lot. And I enjoyed the competitions because Kaggle that that have that, that feeling rather that competition environment, and at the same time that you are learning and reading, forums, kernels, it's spirit addictive. Right. You know,"
10:26,Sanyam Bhutani,How has your journey evolved from your first gold medal from seven years ago to now 47 gold medals. I'm not even going to count the silver and bronze. How is your approach evolved and your views on Kaggle evolved over the years?
10:41,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, I believe my approoch changes over time. And because my skills changes over time, my knowledge and even the tools changes over time, right. As I as I told you, I start with MATLAB then I move it to R"
11:03,Sanyam Bhutani,"There was no Tf, no No Scikit-learn. I believe back in 2012"
11:08,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, yeah, it wasn't on the beginning of this, of this tools. Right. But yeah, I start with MATLAB they moved to R, then Python. But my first approach in the beginning of Kaggle, my journey in Kaggle was very naive. Actually, I started to learn by myself on this competitions, right? I use a lot of Google search to learn on that time. And my first approaches are, I can say are pretty naive. I start to think how to how, actually started thinking how data science and machine learning works, by myself. I tried to define my, my own hypothesis and test the hypothesis. And fine with my errors. So I found that building a good CV, cross validation strategy is essential to in the competition. I, I learned from my errors that trusting the public leaderboard is a mistake."
12:22,Sanyam Bhutani,Multiple problem multiple times.
12:25,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, yeah, but my approaches improved over time. I start, on the beginning I used to quote everything for every new competition. So I started from zero from every new competition. Today I have some libraries I use and I use it when I start the competition but at the same time, most of my code right now, I keep customizing to each specific competition. It's hard to build a generic code that we can use in all the competitions, right? "
13:07,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
13:08,Gilberto Titericz,"Coder pipeline. It's hard to to have it especially for Kaggle that the competitions can come from different areas, different fields. And maybe if you are focusing in a specific field, maybe you can have some code that you can reuse on all the competitions but not not much in Kaggle. Maybe it's it's, it's easier to do that in a company that you can follow the same way of thinking every day. Yeah, but my approach improved over time. Right now I think I have a good approach when I start a competition."
13:51,Sanyam Bhutani,"Talking of domain specific competitions, do you think like it's absolutely necessary to have business knowledge or domain knowledge for such competition or can you even when them without having the knowledge of, let's say physics competition, for example."
14:07,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, no, I don't think you must have knowledge, specific knowledge to win the competition. But of course there's it's not 100% of the time. Right. So I think Kaggle proveth us that anyone can win any competition. Right? We have. I am an example. I won many competitions in areas that I have no idea idea exists before the competition. I won some, for example, medical competitions, but cancer, rent rental prices in Australia. So, some risk competitions. Most different kinds of computers. I had no idea before and I joined the competition I studied a lot about the topic. I knew hundreds of experiments, I found better way to improve the accuracy for that specific area. So, yeah, I believe if you have an expert size in a specific field, you have an advantage from people that are dying in the competition, but it's it's not, this is something yeah, necessary. Yes, necessary. It's better to, you can jump a lot of steps in that competition, because if you have previous experience or expertise in the topic, but it's not absolutely necessary. That's also the idea of Kaggle, right, the Kaggle is, show that the data set the problem to suit everyone and get the best solution from the challenge. That's the idea."
15:57,Sanyam Bhutani,"So coming to your journey, you became an active Kaggler and I was reading that no one at your workplace even knew that you were number one before you even told them before you told you were shifting to data science. So can you tell us how did the transition, like most people try to use Kaggle to transition into the industry, how was the transition for you? And did you have to learn anything outside of Kaggle after you started working as a data scientist?"
16:26,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, that transition is not easy. And it's not fast, right? Actually, I took four years for that transition for me. So during four years, I was learning data science, I was learning machine learning, Kaggle, using the internet. And it took four years for me to change my title from engineer to data scientist, right, so yeah, I used to say to people don't expect to be quick, and expect to have a lot of trouble during the transition and expect it to be slow, a slow transition. If it's going to happen too fast, maybe it's something wrong or maybe you are not prepared yet. But data science is a field that that have a lot of different, it's area with lots of different topics. It's hard to, to have a full knowledge and all these different fields and topics of the area. So it's good to to learn one, one every time, one by one every time every different area of data science or machine learning. So especially in Kaggle, you learn a lot of machine learning. But when you look at side on industry companies, you see there's a broader vision of what is data science, there are other areas that are not present in Kaggle, right. And especially because in companies you are challenged every day to build a Kaggle competition every day, for example, in my company, usually you have a data set that changes every day, every hour, in Kaggle the data set is fixed for the entire competition, right. "
18:36,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah.
18:37,Gilberto Titericz,"So, yeah, the challenge we face in companies outside Kaggle are especially related with data preparation, data acquisition, problem formulation, and all the aspects of building the problem, the challenge, right? Kaggle is more about how to solve it using machine learning. "
19:07,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
19:08,Gilberto Titericz,"And during that transition to the data science science, you find that because most of the things that you learn on Kaggle, and you still can use on the, on outside Kaggle, but you find that you don't know some other areas, present on the, on the daily life of a company, right, like the ones that I told. Also, for example, multiple deployments is something not explored in Kaggle, but it's something very common when you join a company. And it's, there are many ways to do that, and many ways to fail doing that. And, yeah, so that's why I say when you're transitioning to a data science field, you do it, try to do it slowly, not not jumping steps, try to learn all the aspects of Kaggle. And try to understand the difference of Kaggle, and the real life problems to make it most mostly, most smooth as possible that transition. That is my recommendation."
20:22,Sanyam Bhutani,"That's great advice. Coming to your current job, your 're lead data scientist at ople, could you tell us what task are you working on? Is it somewhat related to all of your vast Kaggle experience that you've gathered over the years?"
20:37,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, it is. It's all related with my Kaggle machine learning experience. Ople is using an automated machine learning at product, right, for for, for everyone. And to automate machine learning there are a lot of aspects, a lot a lot of areas to make it possible. But most of the, to make it possible there's a lot of algorithms that make it possible, right? And having that experience in Kaggle helps me to understand better that the machine learning algorithms and provide better ways to build that out to optimal system. And I, I can't tell exactly what we are working on now. But I can tell we are covering all the aspects of the AutoML since data preparation, data, repossessing all the machine learning algorithms available in sampling, stacking, hyper parameter tuning, model interpretation, deployment of models. So all these fields that I've been working on Ople and trying to make it as best,as best as possible to the end user and all my Kaggle experience can be used in order to improve that kind of machine learning product. Because, especially because I have the feel, I have the skill I or at least I improved my my skills on Kaggle right. And I explored the machine learning algorithms the most, I was like I called in Kaggle in order to improve the accuracy of the models. So that kind of experience like tuning hyper parameters, using the best model as possible for each solution, setting a good cross validation strategy. All this is, there's experience and Kaggle can be used in our auto ml products."
22:55,Sanyam Bhutani,"Coming to uh, during your active Kaggle, is still very active but when you were hyper active Kaggle, how did you balance your time with Kaggle family? And you were working in a completely different industry, did you even sleep during that period? That's one question that everyone has."
23:12,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, back to the beginning of my journey in Kaggle at that time, I had two babies and a regular job differently area. So it was pretty hard to balance the Kaggle time, job and family time, right. It was not easy for me at all. Actually, I used to work all the day, then I get home, take care of the children. And only after the children are sleeping, I started Kaggle. "
23:46,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
23:47,Gilberto Titericz,"And I used to spend three to four hours per day on Kaggle at that time. And of course, I I I used to sit very late in the nights, so I didn't sleep much during that period. Maybe I spent 20 to 25 per [Week] on Kaggle during the time. So it's a lot of time if you have a regular job and babies at home. "
24:18,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
24:18,Gilberto Titericz,"And there's no secret or magic to do that. It's, it's a lot of dedication, right? You must dedicate to it once, if it's really what you want. There's no secret sauce. But right now, I'm not spending that amount of time on Kaggle anymore, right. I think right now my job and my family are in the top. So if there's some time left, I go for Kaggle or maybe some video games. "
24:56,Sanyam Bhutani,Hehe.
25:00,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, but right now is my life is different. It used to be like crazy. Six years ago, like spending also the weekends doing Kaggle. But one strategy to do Kaggle is let your computer work for you, right, the computer can work 24 hours per day, you can't, right. So try to think about experimentation, try to set the experiments and leave the computer working on that experiment, because most of machine learning algorithms takes a lot of time to run. If you can manage to, two sets of experiments and leave the computer running during the night, it's a big advantage for you in the competition, right? So don't don't lose much time. So, yeah. That's my advice."
25:57,Sanyam Bhutani,"As you said, like it takes a lot of dedication. I'm sure it takes a lot of talent as well. You have you had had amazing finishes on multiple competitions. If you had to pick your favorite challenge or your favorite battle story if I may, of one competition, but would that be?"
26:15,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, I have many favorites."
26:21,Sanyam Bhutani,"Maybe, maybe your top three or top?"
26:24,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, I believe my favorite competition was the one about the leakage, the Santander one, it's Santandor value production challenge. It's about the leakage that I disclose it on the forum, and I eventually win in that competition. I think this is my favorite one. But I also like the Auto Group product classification competition. It was, it, it was before it was the number one. But it was the first competition that I did a really huge stacking and sampling model. It was a multi class classification. And it was my first trial to build a huge that can ensemble in a solution. So I like this, these two ones, something there because I disclose it the leak and then one and the auto, because I use a very huge stacking to one. But there are other ones I love it. It's my first you about wind forecast and the energy forecasting that I be good good placements. It was very good because I use MATLAB and I won this over some more experienced people than me. I have many favourites, but if I have to choose, I would choose that Santandar one, because I did it a lot of time.,disclose the leak. So everyone was on the same place. And then, of course, not a lot of bit of lucky, but a bit of experience and hard work to win a competition. And we managed to win the competition with it was pretty cool."
28:27,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. There's a question from the AMA section Carlos asks you're well known for spotting target leakage in competition data. Do you have any specific techniques or do the approaches change for every competition?
28:41,Gilberto Titericz,"No, the approach changed over every competition leak, because especially because leakage change, right? Every data set, doesn't matter it can be tabular data, time series or image data or a mix of everything or even NLP, every data set is different. And every data set can be any kind of leakage associated with the data set. On that previous example on the Santander competition, the leakage was about a time series hidden in the, in the data set, but I've seen in some image competition on on the past that there are some timestamps on the mirror data of some image and that the leakage can be different for each problem and the way the leakage is hidden in the data also is different. So, there is no classical approach or the there is no secret. There is it, actually the idea is spend a lot of time taking a look at the data set, understanding the data set, mute some hypotheses and test your hypotheses, right. Because sometimes you spend a lot of time that data set, you find no leakage. And sometimes you can find something that is correlated with the target. It's another of trial and error. It's a bit of lucky also to find that, that issues in the data set, so there is no no, no way to to know if you shouldn't try. And also if I say it's a bit of lucky because you can try anything that comes to your mind, but the leakage is heating something that you didn't test it. So yeah, there's no no regular approach. Every time a customized solution to find out leakage."
30:51,Sanyam Bhutani,What what kind of Kaggle competitions interest you today? What challenges do you look for and how do you decide to enter a competition today?
31:00,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, actually, I try to, to join all the competitions right now, but I just become active in the competition right compete in the competition if I feel comfortable with the data, if I like the data, specially right now if there's no leakage within the data set, right. But my favorite competitions are the ones right, with tabular data or 10 time series data right now. So I prefer to join this, these two competitions. Why? Because I found it in the past that I feel more comfortable with that kind of data. Right? I tried any kind of competitions in Kaggle, all the other types of competition, Kaggle optimization, image segmentation, tabular, or time series all the time and I found this to, tabular and time series are the ones that I like more. I try to join all this kind of competitions ofcourse if the time allows to do that if my free time allows to do that, but yeah,"
32:16,Gilberto Titericz,"This, these are two types I'm, I prefer right now."
32:20,Sanyam Bhutani,"Got it. So even after becoming number one, the best of Kaggle and you held the title for the longest period, I think for two years. Why did you continue to Kaggle even though you're not hyper active, still one of the most active Kagglers, why do you still continue to calcul?"
32:35,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, Kaggle is addictive, right."
32:39,Sanyam Bhutani,Hehe.
32:40,Gilberto Titericz,"But it's not about the prize money. Not about being addictive, but I like to use just you, competing in Kaggle to learn nowadays. I used to read the forums. I used to take a look at the kernels to see what people are doing. But especially I like new, new kinds of competitions, so. I used to be much more active in the past before 2017 but right, right now I am not so active but I am still competing on Kaggle. I still try to to to compete, at least in one competition or time Kaggle right now. "
33:30,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah.
33:30,Gilberto Titericz,"But yeah, but what makes me continue is that the hunger to learn, to learn more. Because you'll never learn enough right. Every day there's something new on the data science area. It's hard to be up to date on the data science. You can have, you can use Kaggle to try new approach to different problems. You keep reading papers reading new approach for new different problems. And, and Kaggle is good to test everything, right? This new approach paper to improve your skills sometimes the, you want to to learn something new. So I like to use Kaggle as a playground. That's why I continue using Kaggle. But I was much more active in the past that, that's true."
34:32,Sanyam Bhutani,"Got it. So, now when you enter a competition and this is a question by Delai50, what are your first tips when starting out on a fresh competition and has the approach evolved over the years, has your outlook on that changed?"
34:47,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, the approach when I enter is, first I understand the competition data. Right? Take a look of the data set. Try to understand the future. How they are currently target, the types of features and what kind of validation strategy we're going to build on that to solve in order to solve that problem, right? Because sometimes you to, to win the competition, you must mimic the test set distribution, the public or private test set distribution on your training set validation. For example, if your, if your private leaderboard in Kaggle, is a time series problem and your private leaderboard is based on seven days of data, try to mimic that pattern on the validation, the training set. I mean, try to make the trade set and the validation most close as possible as the test set validation. This is yeah, this is part of my approach. Usually I spend a lot of time trying to view the reliable validation strategy using the train set. And in using the information we have from the test set. And after that, just after having tried that validation is strategy, think about starting to building good models. I mean, with models, I mean high accuracy models for that competition, right, before that makes no sense. If you don't have a good cross validation or validation strategy makes no sense trying to build high performance models before that. So yeah, set the validation strategy. Maybe spend a lot of time doing that. I'm not saying one, you one or two days, maybe a week or two weeks just thinking about that. Yeah, to make it really reliable, really stable, right? Want to generalize as better as possible in the test set and then start building models using that, that validation strategy and what I mean building models, choosing different machine learning techniques to try models on the data set, maybe if using different views of the data set using feature engineering and eventually experiment with blending different solutions in order to improve their final accuracy. This is my, my very general approach for for a Kaggle problem right now. Most of the time I I must say, it's best, it's best to spend much more time in the beginning, setting that validation strategy, then have to change everything on the last week of the competition or last two weeks then becomes a mess, right?"
38:04,Sanyam Bhutani,"Hehe, yeah. "
38:05,Gilberto Titericz,"######So yeah, it's good. It's good to think that way. Because, and also Trust your your local validation score. It's very important. Sometimes you must look at the public leaderboard score also. But most of the time, if you built your validation strategy correctly, you can trust your local metrics. So right to trust more local than the duplicate leaderboard, that's, that's part of the approach."
38:39,Sanyam Bhutani,"I think that's one of the mistakes that all of the beginners make, and specially you are one of the Grand Masters that has survived, survived most of the shakeups. You're always good at that. Coming to another aspect is teaming up on Kaggle. You've teamed up with multiple Kagglers over the years. What's your teaming up strategy and your advice to beginners who start looking for teaming up because they think it'll help better in terms of performance on the competition."
39:08,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, there are many different teaming strategies. If you are a Kaggle novice, the strategy will be try to team up with a more experienced Kaggler, right. That's, that's easy, because you will learn from that more experienced Kaggler. But if you are a grandmaster, probably you are looking for some complimentary approach for the problem. For example, an approach that's completely different from your approach, and that is my, my main strategy when I team. I ask people to have an idea what approach they are using to solve the challenge and if I find that it is different from my opinion, it's very good to team up with that person or that team in order to have two different viewpoints of the problem."
40:11,Sanyam Bhutani,Yep. 
40:11,Gilberto Titericz,"Because one way to improve the final accuracy of the models is blending modules using different approach. And right. And it is also part of the ensembling technique to have different viewpoints of the, of the problem. "
40:30,Sanyam Bhutani,Yea.
40:31,Gilberto Titericz,"And I think this is most critical part when teaming with a Grand Master, is having something different to add to the solution. Individually, it's hard to find someone that's different from you, especially because if people start to read too much of that Kaggle forums, people start to build very similar, very similar solutions to the problem or the ripple starts to get by as it, by the solutions present on the forum. So, the forum is good, yes, but sometimes you must stop reading the forms and try to build your own customized solution to the problem and it can be difficult doing a competition. It can be something that can improve the accuracy of the final solution, just doing something different from others, right. Also this is why blending GBM model with a neural networks, usually is good for tabular data because they are completely different approach, different origins training algorithms, right."
41:50,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah.
41:50,Gilberto Titericz,"This is similar to merging. Find people that thinks different from you and, and have high accuracy models as well, right. But it's hard to find in Kaggle, people like that. Right? And especially because what I told you people tries to build solutions similar to the others in the forum. And also, it's hard to ask that kind of people, what about this, the solution? Because before teaming up, you cannot share information about the competition, right. So what's the best way to try to tell what are you doing without sharing exactly what you're doing, that's another challenge. So teaming up is not easy. It's not easy in terms of finding the right people to team up, asking the right questions before the teaming up and deciding to teaming up. But what I, what I can say especially for novice people, try to teaming up with people more experienced in Kaggle, if, especially a Master and Grand Master in Kaggle to learn, because this is how I learned in Kaggle also. The beginning I teamed up with more experienced people than me and I learned a lot from that people, I have a lot of tricks and tips also from that teams. And, and I recommend a lot of team. It's something I believe is is is the best way to learn because you can share knowledge in a team. You can learn from the experience of more experienced people and you have that, the advantage of building different approach for each team member and then, and blend all the solutions in one final solution. I think, they mean it's great, great good in Kaggle in all the aspects."
44:03,Sanyam Bhutani,"You're also one of the people who are really great at ensembling and you've, you've given multiple talks that are on YouTube, I could have those linked, but any best advice that you, that you have for, on ensembling all of your models, has your again approach changed over the years?"
44:20,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, ensembling, it's a technique that is very easy to overfeed if you do it the wrong way. So, especially if you have a team you have to set some rules to avoid overfitting in big Ensemble and also you must take care of bugs in the code, especially regarding the cross validation or validation approach because ensembling many models to make it work, you must have out of four predictions for all the models. And when I say out of four, I mean, do some validation strategy, like presentation or time series and moving window validation step by step. So one of my recommendations is do the model out of four predictions is using exactly the same faults for all the models. Why that, why that, to avoid leakage in their folds, between folds of the same model. So if you if you train a model using exactly the same folds for all the models in your pipeline, you make it possible to compare the performance of all the models. This is the number one approach you must take care when doing ensemble right to make sure that you are not leaking information between the folds. "
46:01,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
46:01,Gilberto Titericz,"And once you do that, the stacking becomes something trivial to implement. Basically, you're going to ensemble or merge predictions from different models, right? But I believe people must take care, especially with the foundation. Also, there's one technique, very common in Kaggle nowadays, that is called target encoding, where we use the target information to encode the categorical variables. Also the way how we do the targeting coding can leak information from the faults and this completely destroyed ensemble life. "
46:48,Gilberto Titericz,"And so you must know what you are doing before doing that. And that kind of approach can destroy ensemble generalization, performance on the test set. And in something you must take care when teaming, teaming up with another people because people can have some different understanding about how to run that algorithms. And from one, one single leaking model can destroy an entire assembly of hundreds of models. So this is something that you must take care, avoid leakage and overheated models in ensembles. And yeah, I think, I think I'm ensembling is a pretty interesting topic. I like talking about it more. I use it a lot in Kaggle and the best, and it's one, general way to improve their careers to that to the top, just blending different model relations."
47:59,Sanyam Bhutani,"It's Four novices also also like playing with fire like you said, so you have to be careful. Another thing that's like playing with fire for the noise is hardware and I'd like to touch upon this topic that a lot of your achievements were on a mid range laptop. Do you think it's still possible to perform well in competitions maybe even win on normal hardware, maybe not the deep learning competitions but for the other categories?"
48:26,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, I think it's possible with normal hardware. I started Kaggle using low end laptop, its core i5 with four gigabytes of RAM. "
48:39,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay.
48:39,Gilberto Titericz,"I used a laptop for many years. Then I switched it to a better laptop an, i7 with 32 gigabytes of RAM but no GPU at that time. It helped in my life in Kaggle, I was able to fit more data set memory. But I don't think it's necessary to have a high end specs on their laptop or computer to win a Kaggle competition. Not not, at least not a tabular data competition, right?"
49:17,Sanyam Bhutani,Yep. 
49:19,Gilberto Titericz,"Also Kaggle provides the kernels that have a good amount of memory 16 gigabytes, and four, two or four cores available, so it's enough to win the competition. Because competitions, people that win usually are the people that run more experiments on the data set. And the competition's about running a lot of experiments use on the data set. And most experiments mean more chance you'll have to win the competition because you have more information about the data. And right now, I, I used two use just servers to Xeon servers 18 cores each and a lot of RAM memory and one, at least one GPU in each one. "
50:11,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
50:11,Gilberto Titericz,"But is, is not what makes the difference for me right now. I believe your skills and your knowledge about machine learning algorithms are more important. And, but of course, if you are joining image competition, probably having more GPUs is a big advantage. "
50:33,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
50:33,Gilberto Titericz,"And the, right now there are a lot of competitions running for image classification. So, yeah, it's if you think that winning the competitions is running a lot of experiments and you'll have dozens of GPUs available. You can run maybe dozens of experiments at the same time, right? "
50:54,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
50:56,Gilberto Titericz,"It's different from tabular data that you are, are mainly the restrictions are mainly on the number of CPUs you have. And a little bit about the RAM memory you have available. But I still thinking that table or data in time series data, you don't need to have bigger hardware to win the competition. You can win using even the Kaggle kernels to do that, if you have the enough knowledge and time to invest in the competition. Yeah, but it's not the case for image classification. "
51:35,Sanyam Bhutani,"Hehe, yeah."
51:36,Gilberto Titericz,And you'll get there's a difference between those two kinds of competitions. 
51:41,Sanyam Bhutani,Definitely.
51:42,Gilberto Titericz,"It was based on my experiment, experience, also on both kinds of competitions, but I still like image competitions. I have some GPUs to run, but it's unfair. I think it's not fair for people that don't have access to GPS. Or have only one GPUs available. It's harder to win the competitions using less hardware. Just so yeah, hardware can play a big role in the winning image classification competitions or maybe deep learning competitions, right, if we're talking about natural language processing. Also, you know, some some NLP problems, it's necessary to use large GPUs to run the models, or at least to load the models in GPU memory."
52:31,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah.
52:31,Gilberto Titericz,"But it's not the case for tabular. Also, that's why I like tabular data. I can use my laptop and I can go with my laptop anywhere in the world and still competing without the need of large amount of GPUs. "
52:48,Sanyam Bhutani,"Yeah. Talking about experiments, so there are times for people like me, especially when you get stuck on the leaderboard, you've been running a bunch of experiments, all are failing. What advice do you have for that time, when your score isn't improving, and the competition is still pretty active. How should you come up with new ideas or new experiment?"
53:10,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, that's the tricky part of the data science because it's, it's about your previous experience in doing that, to solving that kind of problem. But it's also about having new ideas, right. And having new ideas is something, it's hard to, to prove that, that kind of skill. And when I'm running a lot of experiments, I try to run the base key ideas that comes to my mind, right and then leave it running. Usually you have some predetermined, predefined ideas that are pretty common between all the types of challenge, but I used to think about the competitions, even where during my work time, or even when I'm sleeping, I'm thinking about competitions. ######Usually some of the ideas comes from that time that you are not competing, that you are resting or playing video game, you're enjoying it. And suddenly the ideas just happens to appear in your mind and you're, you're thinking, okay, maybe I should experiment that new idea I just thought. There's no receipt to that. It's about, it's an art, right? It's something like an art. It's about intuition. What, what are my intuition to solve that problem? If you have a lot of ideas, it's easier because you can prepare a set of experiments and leave it running and, taking notes of the experiment results is pretty important also step to record what you made log, what you made in the past, what you already experiment, experiment."
55:10,Sanyam Bhutani,"That's where the intuition starts to build if, you start to get a rough idea that maybe this is not the best experiment, because this has failed earlier."
55:18,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, yeah, that's when you can use your previous experience to do that. But sometimes you have crazy ideas. And I recommend if you have great ideas, try to implement that crazy ideas. Sometimes it works. At least it works with me some, sometimes crazy ideas helps with the final solution if you're building an assemble of many models. But also there's no recipt how to do that. My recommendation is write anything that comes in your mind if you had enough time to do that. Anything, even crazy ideas and specially if the ideas are different from the ideas of other people in Kaggle, because if you are running it the same, exactly the same approach that other people in Kaggle, you get the same results of the other people. It's very good if you are learning, if you are a novice and you are learning, this is pretty good to try that, that come across, but you're just going to win the competition if you're doing something different from the others, right?"
56:28,Sanyam Bhutani,Mhm.
56:28,Gilberto Titericz,"You should take a look at the, the forums, the prize winners. If you read the solutions, you see they make most of the times things different from the other people. They think out of the box. They, yeah, they code something completely different. Or sometimes some, some step is different, but it's hard to win a competition using a general approach right? Break them in general. So yeah, that's my recommendation, right? Everything and anything that comes your mind, even if you are sleeping and you have idea during the dream, in real life, it happened with me the best."
57:20,Sanyam Bhutani,"What best advice would you have for a novice just getting started on Kaggle, like;"
57:26,Gilberto Titericz,"Okay to a novice, I recommend to read the forums, right? Try, try to attend some online classes, online courses, or any free courses or maybe paid courses online to have an idea of the, the idea of machine learning and data science, but at Kaggle try to read a lot of the forums, try to replicate or at least understand that kernels, Kaggle kernels. And specially try to team up with more experienced at Kaggle. Is is pretty good. Maybe you, you was, you cannot just team with a Grand Master but maybe you can team with an expert or a Kaggle Master. If you have some friend that is a Master or an expert is easier to teaming up. But try to learn from that people, because you can learn how Kaggle works and you can learn how machine learning works. Two different things. ######To learn machine learning, you first need to learn how Kaggle works, right? There's some rows in Kaggle. But another advice is don't try to learn everything on Kaggle, because data science, there are too many fields. If you try to learn everything you get crazy right? Try to have just to know that every field exists, but try to experiment just a bit of every field and try to find they want, the field that you have more, you are more comfortable or you are more interested about how it works. For example, some people can find that natural language processing fits better with the experience of that people's, other people prefer to work with image processing or image classification, other people image segmentation, other people like time series, try to get expert in any, in one specific field before trying to learn other fields right. Don't try to learn everything at the same time you will get crazy. It also is impossible. So many, so many things, so many papers, so many theory. So try to specialize in one specific field and get better on that field before moving to other fields and if you like that you, maybe you should continue to work in that field. Right. I know a lot of people that just work on that field and don't want to change. That's, that's my advice for novice. "
1:00:16,Sanyam Bhutani,"That's great advice. Just like this interview that has been full of great advices. I have a final question. And this is, this will be tough for you. What has been your all time favorite game and your current favorite game? And ps4 or Xbox? Because;"
1:00:35,Gilberto Titericz,"That's the hardest question. I have to think about that. Actually, I have all the game consoles. I have an Xbox. I have all the PlayStations. But, I have a lot of favorite games, maybe for PlayStation four the ones that I liked more what, are the Gods of War series, you know? Yeah, I liked a lot that, that series all the God of War for games, and from the Xbox I love it that Gears of Wars, it's a shooting, shooting game. Gears of Wars 1-2-3-4, then a lot of."
1:01:23,Sanyam Bhutani,5 is also out I think.
1:01:27,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, okay. And but yeah but I have a lot of games that I liked, and not my favorites by, I love for example, Horizon zero dawn for PlayStation 4."
1:01:42,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah.
1:01:43,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah even Spider Man Uncharted, some rolling playing games. There's, there's some new, new releases that's trending right now.  Yeah, there's so many good games and I am a huge fan of games for all my life. I want some, some, some video game competitions before when I was a kid also."
1:02:15,Sanyam Bhutani,So you had that competitive element but if you have to name one favorite game of all time throughout your life that you really like?
1:02:24,Gilberto Titericz,All the time? 
1:02:26,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
1:02:27,Gilberto Titericz,"Well, that's the hardest question, right. Okay, I see the game that I spent most of my time playing the game, wasn't a very old game from PlayStation 1 called Final Fantasy 7. You know the game?"
1:02:48,Sanyam Bhutani,I have played that game.
1:02:51,Gilberto Titericz,"Yeah, I figured that I spend most of my time playing the game. Actually, I spent hundreds of hours playing that game. I just, one game, I love it. Yeah. I think I can choose this. This one, is an old one. I love it."
1:03:08,Sanyam Bhutani,"Awesome. Thank you so much, Grand Master Giba for joining me on the podcast and for all of your contributions to the kernels and discussions on the Kaggle community as well."
1:03:18,Gilberto Titericz,"I appreciate an invitation to be here. And it was a, an honor for me. So thank you also. "
1:03:25,Gilberto Titericz,Thank you.
