0:13,Sanyam Bhutani,"Hey, this is Sanyam Bhutani and you're listening to ""Chai Time Data Science"", a podcast for data science enthusiasts, where I interview practitioners, researchers, and Kagglers about their journey, experience, and talk all things about data science.

Sanyam Bhutani  0:45  
Hello, and welcome to another episode of the ""Chai Time Data Science"" show. In this episode, I interview a data scientist, but from the other side of the world, a data scientist at Kaggle, Walter Reade, also known as Inversion famously on Kaggle. Walter, I believe was the first Kaggle discussions Grand Master. And in this interview, we talk all about his journey into data science and on Kaggle how his journey into data science started via Kaggle. And his journey now and the other side of Kaggle. While working as a data scientist for the team, Walter holds a PhD in chemical engineering. This interview also talks a lot about the science in data science, how Walter has approached problems over the years. And also what does data science on the other side of Kaggle. I feel this is a very special interview in the sense that this time it's a Kaggle Grand Master that is a part of Kaggle's team. So I am really excited to be sharing this interview. Without further ado, here's my interview with Dr. Walter Reed. Please enjoy the show. And for the audience. As a quick reminder, please remember subscribe to my newsletter. You can find the link in the description of this podcast if you'd like to stay updated with the interview releases, and if you're a non native English speaker, please remember to go to YouTube and enable the subtitles for a better watching experience. For now, here's the conversation. Please enjoy the show.

Sanyam Bhutani  2:32  
Hi, everyone. It's a privilege for me to be talking to the first discussions Grand Masters ever. Grand Master Inversion now he's on the other side of Kaggle, but I'm on the call with Dr. Walter Reed. Thank you so much, Walter, for joining me on the podcast."
2:46,Inversion,"Yeah, absolutely. I happy to be here and answer your questions."
2:52,Sanyam Bhutani,"Likewise, I'm really excited. But before we talk about Kaggle and your work before joining Kaggle I want to talk about your body grown because you studied PhD in you did PhD in chemical engineering and you followed a premier traditional path in research. Could you tell us what made you pick me chemistry as a career path and take up research in that domain?"
3:14,Inversion,"Yeah, yeah. So I like telling the story, not because it's particularly interesting, but it just kind of highlights the fact that in today's world, you really can reinvent yourself. And so yeah, so I did a master's in a PhD in chemical engineering, my master's was basically in understanding reaction rates of burning carbon particles. It was experimental as well as modeling. I enjoyed that. And then for my PhD I did it was 100% computationally based, and it was understanding the mechanisms of calculating particles in turbulent fluid. "
3:52,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay.
3:53,Inversion,"So, so the traditional path, this this part is just It almost sounds unreal, but it's kind of Ridiculous when I was in high school, so I was in high school a long time ago, the mid 80s. And just to give you an idea for how things were different, my first computer had two kilobytes of RAM. And I upgraded it to 16 kilobytes of RAM, which was kind of a big deal. And I taken a Pascal class in high school, so I really like programming. And I wanted to go into computers. But when I was getting close to graduating, literally everyone I knew was going into computers. And I, being the genius high school student that I was I thought, well, the market will be completely saturated and there won't be any job by the time I graduate. So probably the same thought process that data scientists who are going into school are thinking well, the all the jobs will be gone. So I ended up studying chemical engineering, for literally the only reason that I thought it sounded. Really cool chemical engineering. Whoo. I had no idea what it was."
5:04,Sanyam Bhutani,You wanted to rebel against the prevalent sentiment? 
5:08,Inversion,"Exactly. So, you know, it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it, it was challenging. Obviously, I went on to get three three degrees. And it gave me a fairly good career path. So so that's kind of my my background. And the idea that oftentimes your path is not as well defined as you think it's going to be kind of life. You just go with how life hands to you and you just as needed."
5:37,Sanyam Bhutani,"Yeah, now when did machine learning start to come into the picture for you. And what even made you being attracted to machine learning?"
5:46,Inversion,"Yeah, so this is another thing I think back so in early 2000s 2001 2002, the company I worked for had distance learning classes that you could take so this was before Coursera And the distance learning classes where were university professors and they would record their, their lectures on DVD and they would mail you the DVDs, you'd watch the DVDs at home, you would do the homework, you would email them the homework, they would rate it. So, it was it was like, you know, Cora before not for Coursera was before Coursera you know, but very, very clunky. And I took this class called computational intelligence, and it was what was really hot back then fuzzy logic which, okay, you know, it was genetic algorithms and it was neural networks. And I really enjoyed the course. And particularly the final project was we had these little 80 by 120, black and white images of soda cans pop cans, and we had to classify which was at a Dr. Pepper was at a Pepsi and I was blown away. way that a computer can learn to recognize these images. Now, what was interesting about this is, you know, we actually didn't write neural networks for this final project, the professor gave us his precompiled windows binary that we ran on our single core machines. And it was still extremely hard to have the, like, the, it was always the verging. So just getting it to actually train and predict was was the challenge. Now, after that, I spent years and years looking for opportunities to apply these tools, but there was such a gap between what they were able to do in any real world problems I, I kind of just gave up and like, this really doesn't solve any any real world problems, which which it really didn't back then. But but it planted the seed that you know, this is kind of some cool stuff that's going on."
7:52,Sanyam Bhutani,"So it seems like you were always ahead of the curve, even in school. Now Kaggle didn't exist in 2001. When when did you discover kaggle? And I know you become addict, you became addicted to it. How did that journey start?"
8:08,Inversion,"So it was in 2012. And I stumbled upon a competition and I don't remember how I don't know if it was an ad or a press release or whatnot. But it is the Merc molecular challenge in 2012. And the idea was is they gave just a huge number, like 10,000 molecular descriptors, and you had to predict basically the molecular activity. And, hey, I'm a chemical engineer up, I thought it was really good at data analysis. The top prize was $25,000. I was convinced this was going to be the easiest money that just like everyone who joins Kaggle like a, you know, I'm going to win the million dollars. And that this in this competition, this is one that Geoff Hinton and his team won in 2012. Right using just to show that neural networks were kind of you could apply them to real problems. I did really poorly under the 300. And some teams, I ended up coming 23rd from the bottom of the leaderboard. "
9:12,Sanyam Bhutani,"Oh, okay."
9:13,Inversion,"Right. So, you know, people go in, like Kaggle hard. Yeah, it was it was not only hard it was it was like embarrassing. I was I was upset I was I kind of crushed my view that I knew how to do data analysis. And that was, in my opinion, a really good thing because what it taught me was, there were all of these tools, new tools that I just had no idea existed, and it really did light a fire under me to you know, get better and to learn these tools. And that was really what started my journey. So it was it was a it was both the the interestingness of it, as well as the I was a little upset that I couldn't do well in these things that that that led me to to enter quite a few competitions."
10:00,Sanyam Bhutani,You accepted the challenge served by Kaggle. 
10:03,Inversion,"Yeah, yeah. But, but but with a lot of fear and trepidation and intimidation and self doubt in, you know, my guess is what tons of people who joined kaggle feel, you know, I just, you know, it's like, okay, you know, it seems like I succeeded, but it was it was a rough journey to start."
10:23,Sanyam Bhutani,"Now you were active as a competitor for quite a long time. And I actually checked your profile you competed in 84% competitions in a solo, which is without a team. Can you tell us more about your competitive journey and if you have any favorite what I like to call barty stories from the competitions?"
10:42,Inversion,"Yeah. So you know, it's interesting, when you look at my numbers, you know, if you if you scroll through my my competitions, a lot of more so a lot of them were weren't really good, but I tended to enter every single competition that that was launched, and ofcourse, it's very difficult to focus on two or even three competitions. So what I would tend to do is I would join every competition, I would start it, see if it was fun, see if I was doing well, and then kind of just like jettison the ones that weren't in terms of joining the team, yeah, I didn't do a lot of team competing and one of the reasons was is I didn't feel like I was worthy to join another team and drag them down on the leaderboard and again, that's another mental block that I had. You know, it took me a few competitions before I did any, any, you know, anything that I would be proud of on the leaderboard. And once I started doing that, then it was like, okay, now I'm really really addicted because okay, I can I can actually get better and you see the progress. You know, the teams that I were on, were really meaningful. I like personally, I did some very large teams I did some small also, one or two people to like the, like the one or two people that I joined with that were the most rewarding. The ones that were larger, typically not as fun. So battle stories. We were disqualified from one competition that was a two stage competition because the team leader was doing things until the very last minute and miss the model upload timeline by 16 seconds. There's a deadline, you had to upload your stage one model, we missed it by 16 seconds. were disqualified from that competition. I also it's a funny story. I don't want to give too many details but I was working with somebody who was very, very good and all neural network studying them in a PhD program but couldn't cross validate worth like didn't understand cross validate cross validation and how you're supposed to do it. So the no, just the little things that you know, as I as I look back were are fun to reminisce on."
13:05,Sanyam Bhutani,Did you check later if you would have won the competition had had they made the 16 second deadline? 
13:11,Inversion,"Ah, yeah, I probably did. didn't do that well, so maybe Uh, yeah, I didn't, I didn't feel really really badly."
13:21,Sanyam Bhutani,"Okay. You will also the first discussions Grand Master and this was achieved by you after they redid the rankings, which meant that you were already very active in discussions unlike people like me who aim to become a Grand Master because it's already there. You were active by yourself. Could you tell us about your community journey and what led you to being so active there?"
13:42,Inversion,"Yeah. So I you know, I I joined Kaggle in the night I joked with Anthony Goldbloom that I was working for Kaggle for five years before. So once I again, I came to Kaggle very intimidated that I was the only one I didn't know what he was doing, which of course is false. We most of us don't know what we're doing. And, and so it was very tentative to start participating on the forums. But once I did it, it was a very good experience. Kaggle If you think of your online communities, Kaggle is amazing in the sense of people. It's, it's strange, because it's competitive, but yet people are willing to help and, you know, give ideas and suggestions and help you forward. So, so that became very rewarding. Then, you know, the other thing I kind of joke, but it's not true anytime I was when I was doing my real job, I was bored, they would just go on to the Kaggle forums and participate in the fact that I had 1200 forum posts suggest that I avoided my real job quite a bit over those years. But, you know, again, I look at our forums and it's, it's really as a sense of pride. When I joined Kaggle, there have been others that have really stepped up to the plate, you've interviewed some of those people who have just become incredible resources to the community. And yeah, it's really neat to see that."
15:14,Sanyam Bhutani,"I think like, like you said, sorry."
15:17,Inversion,"But the one thing I would say is, you know, no matter where you are in your journey, if somebody has helped you, when you get to the point where you can help somebody answer a question, just just, like, try paying it forward as quickly as possible. And once you start doing that, that mindset, you don't have to be the top, you can, you know, just be above 2% then start helping that 2% when you get the 5% help the you know that 4% and keep doing that and that'll get you where you need to be."
15:47,Sanyam Bhutani,"But it's not just rewarding in terms of upwards but also the community starts to recognize you and you start to see those familiar little icon of faces that always become active I'm it's also a warm and welcoming community in that sense, if I may. Now, now, coming to community, do you have any favorite moments from the discussion then you favorite again stories that you'd like to mention?"
16:12,Inversion,"Yeah, so there's I thought of a few, but unfortunately a lot of them were kind of like controversial and drama. And so I don't necessarily want to focus on those, but they do stick to my mind. You know, there was an incident where there was a very, very, very well respected, kind hearted, I don't know who's a Grand Master at the time, but very high ranked, who had passed away and the outpouring of support towards this individual again reinforced What a wonderful community we have. You know, I mentioned the support and the sharing. But on top of that Kag- the Kaggle community does a good job of keeping it light hearted so we we do get in our little fights and spats and arguments, but for the most part, there's not there's no not a lot of posturing and politics. It's people wanting to learn in this people also having fun. So it's that combination that I really enjoy."
17:11,Sanyam Bhutani,"Okay, now once you became active in Kaggle, after that you made a switch into machine learning role, which I believe many people even look for when the signing up on Kaggle. Can you tell us more about the transition? And how was calcula helpful in making you helping you make that transition?"
17:27,Inversion,"Yeah, so I spent about 15 years in industry, and, you know, it was the jobs are fine. I really, I missed that kind of intellectual challenge that you had in grad school. And I think so many people are in that spot. And, you know, so Kaggle was, for me, it was a way to, you know, have that be learning on something that is fun, but solving a problem and doing something that I thought was really kind of interesting to work on. And probably about three ears when I started to rise in the Kaggle ranks, I mentioned to my boss, you know that Kaggle and I have these skills and he was really supportive like he would he would tell other directors and people and so I kind of within the company I was working for, which is a consumer products, they started to get a little bit of a reputation. And it was interesting because it opened some doors to work with various teams that were struggling solving some problems with data. And I was able to do a few side projects like this working with teams, and what I found was curious was oftentimes they would start explaining their, their project and because I had done so many kaggle competitions, I would be like, Oh, right. So what you need to do is this, this, this because this is going to be a problem. So if we and they'd be like, like, hot you notice like, well, because I did three eg problems. So I understand how to do the signal processing or whatnot. So you don't want to talk about Kaggle it's what one of the few places that you can Explore so many different types of machine learning problems, right? So that's a plus. So I started doing side projects, but it was very slow going and like said, After about three years, I really wanted to make a decision. I'm going to do machine learning and data science. It's like that's going to be my career, either here or somewhere else. And so I spent about six months, literally every day looking at all the new job postings. Okay. Again, this fits into this intimidation and you know, I'm not worthy. And so I really wanted to see what people were posting. See if I had the skills and I finally pulled the trigger. The first one, I didn't pass the phone interview. I like completely screwed up some question about Python classes. It was an easy question. I just didn't do a lot of coding with classes. Okay, just parenthetically, we ran a competition with this company that rejected me within the last year. Funny. So then then I started, you know, over time getting better kaggle and two companies reached out to me and not always going through the interview process with both of these and very, very close to sealing the deal. And then I got a promotion at my current company, and the idea was that it was this role, but I'd be able to apply some of the machine learning I, you know, this is a great opportunity for me. And so, that kind of sidelined going to these other companies, and which was actually a good thing, because I think if I had joined these other two companies, I would have passed on the Kaggle opportunity."
20:43,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. How did the dots then connect for you? You later joined Kaggle. What was the story there?
20:51,Inversion,"Yeah, so these, so this was in the fall of 2016. And then in the spring of the next year 2016-17 you know, about six months later the job was I was not doing the machine learning that I thought it would be doing. It was like, you know, months and months of battling with it to even get like a GPU to do neural network training. So I, I would, I would do my training at home and take the model to work. Right. "
21:21,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay.
21:21,Inversion,"So it was it was really frustrating. It was like, again, I was like, do I want to spend all my time doing the political battles. And on my birthday in April, I got an email from Anthony Goldman. They said that, you know, we've been acquired by Kaggle or by Google. And so now we're expanding your data science team, and, you know, would you would you like to apply and I was having dinner with my wife and my daughter and I got this email. And so I was like, super excited. And I read this to my family to my daughter who's 16 at the time, says, Dad, that's that sounds like a scam email. So, yeah, so that kind of course I was. Absolutely, you know, more than happy to. So then Anthony told me about the Google interview process. And you said, but don't don't worry. We'll send you there's a book you can study up on and I got the book it was 700 pages cracking the coding interview. "
22:21,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
22:21,Inversion,"And, you know, again, this this fear and intimidation, this this whole imposter I'm not worthy syndrome kicked in and I had actually drafted a letter to Anthony, giving all these really bad excuses reasons why I wasn't going to do the interview or, you know, go through the process, but okay, I decided, you know, what, this, I'm going to kick myself if I pass this up, went through the process and ended up doing okay, working Kaggle."
22:50,Sanyam Bhutani,Can you tell us more about your current role? What parts of the operations do you handle?
22:56,Inversion,"So, yeah, so Kaggle is, you know, we have a lot of engineers who're working on making notebooks and journals and data sets and all of that. The data science team has really broken up into two parts. We have our program managers, and we have our data scientists, the program managers handle all the inbound leads, by the way, Kaggle gets far more inbound leads than than we can manage. Most of those are, this isn't going to make a good competition, but the ones that are so they work with them and kind of help them understand what needs to happen. We get sample data from them. Once we get the sample data then the data scientists kicking so you know, that's a me Sawyer Dane Phil C, And Will K, we basically say, is this a good problem? Is always the data public is, you know, it's the data set large enough is there leakage, we kind of go through that and ultimately, prepare the data for the competition. So it's, you know, one of the things I really liked about Kaggle competition is how modular was it, you know, you do a PhD program, it's four years or longer working on one problem Kaggle it's like, if you get sick of the competition in three months, and you're done, you get another competition. And it's the same thing with the work that we do is it does overlap, you know, quite a bit. But, you know, we get to work on all sorts of interesting problems, whether it's, it's, you know, signal data, astronomical data, you know, whales, you name it, we can we work on it."
24:32,Sanyam Bhutani,And if I dare to say you also get to do all of the cutting edge research or applications that are they in the industry if you working on a domain specific competition.
24:42,Inversion,"Yeah. And that's actually funny too, because, you know, I look at the people who, I'll give you an example the recent quantum chemistry atomic coupling one I look at what people did, I'm like, I don't understand sequence models. it so it actually highlights the gap of one I don't know when you look at what the winners are doing. And so it's, it's, I kind of believe no matter where you're at, you're always going to feel like there's such a large gap between you and what you need to know. But the, to your point, being able to see what people are doing and know what they're doing so that if I were to work on a type of problem, you know, at least where to look, I think that's a very valuable resource to have on Kaggle. "
25:29,Sanyam Bhutani,"That's interesting. Also currently, you're a developer advocate, a data scientist and even act in the community. If you were to pick your favorite tasks of your everyday which, which one do you enjoy the most?"
25:43,Inversion,"Yes, so in terms of the community, I, if you look at my stance, it really hasn't changed over the years. And I view Kaggle is one of the best places to learn machine learning and data science, the things that were the leaderboard doesn't lie, you know, there's things you can well, you're just ensemble to get, that's true. But the reality is you have to produce good models, you have to iterate quickly. And in terms of a free resource where you can go and get your hands dirty on all sorts of problems, there isn't a better place. So my favorite thing is when we have these pockets of drama, and people are upset, and often rightly, for real reasons of just being able to take a step back and say, hey, look at look at what we have, and look at what it provides. To me, and I do enjoy that. Because, you know, I look at what Kaggle has taught me and provided me, I'm just not and and by the way, 2012 when I started Kaggle that's when Coursera also launched. And, you know, back in the so when I was a kid, you there was no Google if you didn't know something you had to go to the library. Okay. And then you know if I was to take courses, if I wanted to take this instead, of course, somebody had to email me DVDs. And then we have Coursera, where you can take Andrew Ng course for free. "
27:07,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. 
27:07,Inversion,"So yeah, I view these things is just absolutely amazing democratizing these things to anyone who has the interest in drive and motivation to do it. And so I love taking a step back and looking at the hirevue."
27:22,Sanyam Bhutani,"I think the sentiment is also we were just talking about this, but reflect in the community as well, people, no matter where they are in the leaderboard, or no matter in what hierarchical position they are, they'll always go ahead and share all sorts of amazing information in writeups during after before the company since even. "
27:41,Inversion,"Yeah, yeah, one of the things so Addison Howard is one of our product managers. And what he started doing was writing these summary emails listing out here's all of the summaries. Here's all the top kernels and you look at that you're like, what is being shared is just amazing. Yeah. So, again, working at Kaggle, but just seeing that summary is is like wow."
28:08,Sanyam Bhutani,"If if I again, if I may say this in three months, the community comes together creates this plethora of resources of kernels of discussions and later human solutions, that if you go through, you can learn much more than at least what I learned during my college days."
28:25,Inversion,"Yeah, absolutely, for sure."
28:29,Sanyam Bhutani,"Now about competitions, I can, unfortunately speak very little about competing because I only competed in a few tiny few numbers. But to talk about the other side of hosting the competitions, can you give us some insight about what efforts go into hosting a competition? This is just download the data and upload it for your other other things that we as competitors miss."
28:52,Inversion,"Yeah. Well, one of the things that absolutely blew me away was how many possible leaders vectors there are in data. And, you know, you, you know, for the, the bits of leakage, so if your competitors and oh, you know, seems like all the competitions have leakage, that is like a little drop out of the swimming pool got rid of it before we lost the competition, you know, you think of image images and you have to look at the metadata that different types of can't, you know, camera, the image size. You know,  here's, there's, and, and the thing is, is, you know, there's one data scientists who scrutinizing this, then we launched the competition and you have 2000 data scientists who are scrutinizing it, so that that thing alone really does keep us up at night, trying to think of all the different ways that not only the data can have leakage, but also be abused in some sort of way. Then the other challenges, you know, some sponsors are absolutely fantastic. Some have these weird ideas of the types of metrics we should use that are really kind of not very good metrics that will drive the wrong behavior. So, so there's also a component where we have to kind of use soft skills to convince us hosts or sponsors to, you know, do things differently."
30:19,Sanyam Bhutani,"Okay, now, again, talking about the other side of competing was actually competing in competitions. Can you tell us about your favorite competition that you competed in? And do you miss being active on competitions now? Because you're not as active as you used to be early?"
30:34,Inversion,"Yeah, so so absolutely. I say I joke but I'm serious that like, the day I leave Kaggle over there, I get fired, or you know, whether I retire or whatever it is, I'm gonna compete again because I find it so rewarding. "
30:51,Sanyam Bhutani,Okay. 
30:53,Inversion,"My favorite one was, you know, I had three competitions where I didn't do so well you know, the first and then a couple after then the fourth one I did was the acquired shopper value. And the idea was, you're given a year's worth of purchases from a person. And the idea was is okay, we're going to send these people a coupon. So I, so the data is on people who got the coupon, predict which ones would. And they all redeem the coupon, predict which ones would then continue to buy the product. In other words, you want to send it to the people who are going to be most valuable for your for this coupon. And the reason it was my favorite was because I was it was about 1000 competitors, I was about 500. So like, middle of the road. I was using logistic regression, because that was the only thing I knew how to use at the time, right. That was it. That was my tool, binary classification. And I started doing a lot of VDA. And I saw this thing in the data and I realized if I took these kind of this group out and train separate models on these groups that I jumped from 500 to 50. Just Just doing that one little insight, and I ended up 32nd. So that was my favorite just because it was so exhilarating to suddenly do well, and to realize that I wasn't working any harder. I was just had an insight in the data. So, yeah, I found that very rewarding, very motivating, and that again, helped. Keep me addicted to Kaggle."
32:29,Sanyam Bhutani,"While you still using logistic integration, and you'll find little 32nd position solution."
32:34,Inversion,"Yeah, yeah. No, it was it was. I mean, I think I think my computer had eight megabytes or gigabytes of RAM at the time. I barely knew any Python and I may have actually even been using like an old copy of MATLAB at the time because that's all I had. Okay, there was this time where I was I started using some commercial software that I had. And then you know, MATLAB and realizing all this isn't going to cut it. And so that's, you know, I had to learn Python. Then I realized, well, my computer's not going to cut it. So you know, you kind of do this journey of I got to improve my tools, I have to improve my, my, my knowledge. And that was very early at the time, right? I didn't have very many tools."
33:18,Sanyam Bhutani,"Okay. Now, again, to go back and summarize your journey, you started competing on Kaggle. After taking a few courses, then you switched into machine learning slash data science role, and then you joined Kaggle. Now, to people who are just signing up on Kaggle. Looking at this journey origin is similar to this what parts do you think we are missing? What parts might they miss? Being a data science newbie or data science enthusiast or newbie calculus?"
33:46,Inversion,"Yeah, you know, what I experienced? What seven years ago about being intimidated. It's only gotten worse, right? "
33:54,Sanyam Bhutani,"Oh, sure. "
33:55,Inversion,"It's it's only gotten worse for a number of reasons. Number one Kaggle's a much bigger place. So whereas 900 teams was big seven years ago now we're almost you know, their competition we have almost 9000 teams so there's that the the fact that data science has exploded so much, you know, seven years ago if you are using a random forest you are cutting edge you were you know, an XP boost that was the high tech now it's like XP boost right? That's like the baseline and then it's even worse if you think of all of the the neural network type architectures that seem to just become out like, like mad right it's it's, it's, it's hard to keep up with them. So here's, here's the one. Let me let me give a tip that I think is very appropriate is even seven years ago, even back then I realized you can't learn it all. at once. You can't learn it all and especially you can't learn and also I would join competitions, not necessarily to win, but what did I need to learn next. So like, Okay, I need to learn combinational neural network, I would join a competition. And I would just focus on learning combinational neural I was I didn't care if I where I placed, right? Top 30 or whatever I tried to do well, and I think that's the most important thing is forget what's going on and look at yourself and say I don't know how to do random force, okay? Enter tabular and just, I'm just gonna learn how to do random forests. I'm gonna learn how to cross validate, I'm gonna learn SK learn, I'm gonna, you know, and just do that and then make a plan, and then take the next step. But it's really easy to go, oh, everyone's doing x g boost. I'm know learn random for this, then learn x g boost. And, you know, and that's, that's to me. And it's very, it takes a lot of self control because you want to, like, there's always the shiny toy. I remember, back when neural networks were starting to get more active income. People say, Well, I tried this neural network didn't work. What neural network are you using? I'm using lasagna! I'm always learning. I'm using Keras, which it's like, you're, you're chasing the wrong thing."
36:08,Sanyam Bhutani,Yeah. And when do you say this one should jump onto competition? Should they complete a PhD in chemistry or do a few courses or just jump in?
36:18,Inversion,"I think it's good for sure to know the basics. You know, the tools in data science have become much more push button. And that's a good thing. But it's also important to not skip at least the fundamentals, like understand what's going on, you know, like the, how's the logistic regression work and what's gradient descent? And how does how does the decision tree work and okay, so how you go from that to a random forest x g boost? I think it's, you don't need to know like the be able to derive the equations or write the code, but you need to understand the fundamentals. I've seen some well meaning people use some very powerful tools and really burned themselves because they didn't understand the basics."
37:08,Sanyam Bhutani,"Okay. And once someone joins a new competition, how should they go about it? And do you have any suggestion on what competitions to join to team up or not team up? What approach is to take? Should they just copying for the top ranking kernel during that time?"
37:25,Inversion,"Oh, so first of all, I would say do what you're comfortable with it. If you're new, I would, I would recommend not to teaming up with somebody that you know, already. Don't join and say I just want to team up with somebody because you don't know who that person is or what they can contribute. So I would, you know, approach it as a way to get yourself comfortable, don't worry where you place if you know somebody team with them like, especially if you're co located you work together as a team and help and explore different things. The most important thing is don't worry. It took me four competitions before I started to do halfway decent, like no one goes and wins their first competition. It's happened, actually. But it's very, very rare. In terms of should I fork a kernel? If all you care about who I can get high on the leaderboard by forking current kernel, don't do it. I would recommend that you approach the problem and write your own very simple code like the bare minimum. I'm going to write the regression logistic regression, the bare minimum, I'm going to no feature engineering. Let me just process the data and see how that does kind of like a naive dummy ma model. I would do that. The exception if the data requires a lot of pre processing, then I think it's fine to swipe some code right. Some people do some extra Here's some pre processing. But otherwise no I would, I would just start from scratch and see how far you get. And then later you can start incorporating what other people are doing. But I wouldn't just swipe and start with theirs, I would start with yours and pull from other people's in build it into yours. That's what I would recommend."
39:21,Sanyam Bhutani,"Okay, and this is a stupid question but do you think one can learn data science by competing and this originates from the opinion that hey Kaggle's not data science opinion that's now trending slightly on on social media?"
39:34,Inversion,"Yeah, I mean, it's it's easy to say Kaggle's not data science, because you have to define what data science is and is data coming to putting models into production is data science. You know, writing algorithms is a data science cleaning your data, if data science was working with organizations to get their legacy systems and clean up their data, this there's no fun in that right. Kaggle is the fun part. Data Science, in my opinion, there's plenty of other skills that are important to know and to learn. But it's it you know, Kaggle is like, to me the most critical right, you learn how not to overfit. You learn how to quickly do exploratory data analysis, how to rate quick models, baseline models. So can you learn data science? I would say that, absolutely you, you will learn what works in data science. I have read a lot of papers and tried to implement them and they don't work very well. Kaggle is ruthless. If it works, people are going to use it. If it doesn't work, they're not going to use it. So if you want to learn what works in data science, that's where Kaggle is really helpful. You know, there's things that aren't helpful ensemble in 20 models isn't very helpful. But I've talked to some Grand Masters who say, who do very well and they say I will make one neural network model and focus on feature engineering. And then I'll do one tree based model focus on feature engineering and I'll ensemble those two models and they do very well because the focus on the feature engineering and understanding that the problem."
41:22,Sanyam Bhutani,Do you think there any aspects that may be a data science might miss while just competing on Kaggle now can they fulfill them if there are any?
41:32,Inversion,"Yeah, so for sure, when, when you most machine learning people are data science when they go to a real corporation, there's this reality of you end up spending more times in meetings and talking about what you're going to do and how you get access. You of course, you don't get that on on Kaggle. Kaggle does tend to give you a much more encapsulated cleaner problem with a defined bit of question. I think in the real world, you have to think through what exactly are what question are we trying to answer? And how do we best answer that? And what's the data? We need to answer that. And what's, you know, do we need more? Do we need less? So those are, are very, very important skills that you're not going to develop on Kaggle because we give you the problem."
42:22,Sanyam Bhutani,"Okay, now, my final question to you would be, do you have any best advice as if I may, the official representative of Kaggle for any newbie characters who are just getting started on competing or just learning via Kaggle."
42:36,Inversion,"Yeah, just this the thing I've been saying, just suppress that anxiety and fear and intimidation and inadequacy suppress that? I felt it seven years ago, I still feel it when I see the top category solutions I like when I again I'm competing against this and just go and have fun and you know, I promise you know, you will be rewarded by what you learn, even if you never win a gold medal, even if you just, you know, win some run some silver, what you learn will will be useful. And hopefully you'll have a great time you'll be hard pressed to find a community that is more supportive of you as a newcomer as somebody who you know, it may not know everything. So, jump into community, have fun, help other people and and then like you start doing good, pay it forward and help the people who have just joined Kaggle."
43:34,Sanyam Bhutani,"Awesome. Before we end the call, can you mention the platforms where we can follow you and follow your work?"
43:41,Inversion,"Oh, sure. Wow. I'm so Twitter. Let's see. I think Walter is Walter Reed. Without a dot, Walter Reed is probably the the main place that I post, I'm intermittently sometimes I post a lot. Sometimes they don't. That's probably the best place. Please feel free to tag me on the forums at Inversion. I'll just say so that name does not come from any mathematical theory people out here, you know, it's, it's, I like to ride roller coasters in my spare time. So you know, roller coaster seven versions. So if there's anything I can can do to help let me know. "
44:25,Sanyam Bhutani,Awesome. Is that the story behind your username Inversion?
44:29,Inversion,"That is exactly my username. Yeah. I tend to get into these hobbies and go kind of hog wild and there was one year I went to 14 different Amusement parks and road east it's different roller coasters and I was hooked, I was making like maps and pins on them where the roller coasters were. So on a business trip, I couldn't make sure I got to a very, very into roller coasters."
44:54,Sanyam Bhutani,"Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much, Walter for this very honest opening and very insightful opinion about Kaggle and your journey and thank you so much for joining me on the ""Chai Time Data Science"" podcast."
45:06,Inversion,"Yeah, thank you so much for giving the opportunity I really enjoyed it."
